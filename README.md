## Software and Platform
We performed a sentiment analysis using R Studio to examine the lyrical content of Taylor Swift's songs over time. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing tecnique that categorizes text into distinct emotional tones or sentiments. In our study, the sentiment categories include "Desire", "Confidence", "Love", and "Sorrow", along with a general sentiment classification, "Sentiment QDAP", whcih evaluates whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative.

## Documentation Map:
1. Our project utilizes a dataset titled 'ts_discography_clean.csv', which contains a cleaned version of Taylor Swift's complete distography, which we also have under the file titled, 'ts_discography_released.csv' The dataset has been refined to eliminate multiple releases of the same song. This step was necessary due to the unique nature of her distography, where many songs have been re-released as part of her protest for artist rights, following the sale of her original masters without her consent. For the purpose of oour analysis, we have excluded these re-releases to ensure that the sentiment analysis relfects the emotional tone adn lyrical intent at the time of the songs' original release, providing a more accurate representation of her evolving mindset.
